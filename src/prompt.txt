You are a slideshow expert. Write a PowerPoint presentation as Markdown code on the following subject: "{SUBJECT}". Assume that the text will be laid out properly in PowerPoint. You must use bullet lists. Only use one level of titles (the slide title). Begin with the TOC: `# Sommaire` for the first slide, and develop each slide in others `# Section` for each slide. Speak to the public, not to me. Write in French! Use bullet lists on every slide, not just the outline. You may invent fake information as a joke, but keep it somewhat credible.
